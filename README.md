A Step-by-step User Guide for 3D-CropAnalyzer

With the advancement of agricultural technology, the application of point cloud data in crop monitoring and management has become increasingly widespread. To assist agricultural practitioners in processing and analyzing rice point cloud data more efficiently, this software is developed based on Python and utilizes the PyQt5 library to create a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The software aims to provide a convenient tool for agricultural personnel to extract useful crop information from rice point cloud data, offering valuable insights for subsequent agricultural decision-making. The step-by-step user guide detailed below is based on the Windows executable file.

1.1	Access the software 

The software is running on Windows 10. Installation requires a user to download the file from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/HGF11/3D-CropAnalyzer), and then run the software by double clicking the .exe executable. 

1.2	Pre-processing point clouds generated by the UAV-LiDAR system

1.2.1 Denoising

In this section, users can apply denoising to the selected point cloud file. The parameters are set to default values, but users can adjust them as needed. Press the "OK" button to start the denoising process.

1.2.2 Ground point separation

In this section, users can perform ground point separation on the denoised point cloud. By clicking "CSF Cloth Simulation," the parameters are set to default values, but users can adjust them as needed. Press the "OK" button to initiate the ground point separation process.

1.2.3 Plot segmentation

In this section, users can divide the point cloud into smaller segments as needed. By clicking "Plot Segmentation," the parameters are set to default values, but users can adjust them according to their requirements. Press the "OK" button to initiate the segmentation process.

1.3 Result Output

The calculation process for the phenotypic parameters is embedded within the program. Users only need to click the corresponding parameter button to generate the results. The results are saved as an Excel file, which will be created in the same folder as the program.
